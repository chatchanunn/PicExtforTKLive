# TikTok Shop Image Enlarger Extension

This Chrome extension enlarges product images on the TikTok Shop live product dashboard when you hover over them. A floating 400x400 pixel preview appears above the original image. Clicking anywhere else or moving the mouse away hides the preview.

## Installation
1. Open Chrome and navigate to `chrome://extensions`.
2. Enable **Developer mode**.
3. Click **Load unpacked** and select this repository folder.
4. Visit `https://shop.tiktok.com/streamer/live/product/dashboard` and hover over a product image.

The larger image will appear as a modal over the page and disappear when you click elsewhere.
